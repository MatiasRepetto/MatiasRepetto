## Preferred Programming Languages

1. **C++**
   - Known for its high performance and versatility, C++ is one of my favorite languages. I appreciate its ability to handle low-level programming as well as object-oriented features.

2. **C**
   - As a fundamental language, C has a special place in my heart. Its simplicity and efficiency make it a powerful tool for system-level programming and embedded systems.
